# Visually Basic Compiler

**Repository:** https://github.com/lmorgenthaler/visually-basic-compiler

## Reflective Summary

This project is a multi-stage compiler for a "girly-coded" Visual Basic programming language, 
implemented in Java. The compiler includes lexical analysis, parsing with ANTLR, construction of abstract
syntax tree (AST) and intermediate representation (IR) tree nodes, semantic analysis 
with symbol tables and scope management, and code generation targeting JASM bytecode. Over multiple 
iterations, I implemented support for control flow constructs, arrays and records, functions, and 
type checking/construction. The project required iterating feature construction into multiple phases 
to ensure correctness and consistency in the architectural integrity of the compiler.

I selected this project for my portfolio because it represents one of the most intellectually demanding 
experiences in my computer science education. Building a compiler required deep critical thinking about 
language semantics, abstraction, and execution order, and it strengthened my ability to reason about 
complex systems. This project strongly supports Computer Science learning goals related to programming 
languages and software design. It also aligns with Westminster’s Critical Thinking, Creativity, and 
Communication learning goals through iterative debugging, language design decisions, and clear explanation
of compiler behavior.
